SmartBullet is a Node.js application that I created in a team of three in my Web Services course (COP4814). This application aims to provide a platform for FAU students to share create, share, and view flyers, and also chat with each other. 

In this project, I was the software architect, and project manager. Leading my team, I used various technologies such as MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js, Google API, Facebook API, Twitter API, IBM Bluemix Cloud Deployment, and Trello (Agile development) to develop Smartbullet.
